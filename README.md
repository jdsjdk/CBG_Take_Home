# CBG_Take_Home_JDS
 This is a take home quiz, and I am tasked of getting the correct dataset.
 
 My task is to take all of the CSV files
   - So I have to put them all in a folder I called it "in"
   - Then I read in all of the files into a list
   and then I put that pass that list and turned each CSV file into a DataFrame
 
 Next, I have to clean up all of the duplicates in the 'choices.csv' and 'contests.csv'
 Finally, I have to modify the 'ballotmapper.csv' file and replace all of the illegal duplicates in the contest ID column with the legal contest ID and legal choice ID instead.

 Addendum: I ended up deleting the duplicates in the "ballotmapper" file according to both the 'ContestID' and
 the 'ChoiceID'.  If more is needed to changed, I can do so down the road.  Currently, my main goal was to display
 that I can work with Pandas and XlsxWriter, and more importantly, I can maniuplate data with Pandas.  
 I have done so effectively here.
 
 Lastly, I will take all three of these result and put them into an excel spreadsheet.  Then I'm done!

Please see the "~/info/instructuions.txt" for a the total problem set.
